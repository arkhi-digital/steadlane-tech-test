# Stead Lane Tech Test

Thank you for your interest in working at Stead Lane. We would like to invite you to complete this technical test so that we can assess where your technical skill is currently at, which will help us to decide where to place you within the company.

## Scenario

You are a developer working for a small indie open-source agency which happens to create open-source packages for the community and gets sponsored through Github to do so.

Your manager has asked you to create a little application that will be embedded into the companies website to showcase the awesome open-source work the organisation does.

She has requested that you develop a small application that uses the [Github API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference) to grab the organisations Github repositories and list them out on a webpage with a clean modern UI and making sure to display each of the following data points for each repository:

- The repositories branches
- The last commit to the repository
- The last release to the repository and any release notes associated with it
- The number of forks
- The number of stars
- The number of watchers
- A list of contributors, showing basic profile information such as a name, and their profile picture, as well as how many commits/contributions they've had toward the repository

## Requirements

- Please only spend a maximum of **2 hours** on the project, and try to do it all within one sitting.
    - Do a commit when you start, and a commit when you finish.
- We are happy for you to use whatever front-end frameworks you want.
- Complete as many of the requirements as possible, but don't feel like you need to complete all of them. We'd rather see creative ways or clean ways to get the data and display it, than getting it all in a hacky way.
- You can choose any Github organisation to list the repositories from, but we recommend a popular organisation like: [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft)

## Extras

If you manage to have some leftover time, then completing some of these extra requirements would work within your favour:

- Filter repositories by name
- Mobile responsive
- Implement some animations to help highlight the companies ability to create
